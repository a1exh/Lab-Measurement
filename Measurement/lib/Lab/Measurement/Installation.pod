Lab::Measurement::Installation - Installation guide for Lab::Measurement

=head1 Introduction

Since Lab::Measurement does not contain any device driver code itself, its installation is 
pretty straightforward. However, before you can actually use it, you will have to install
a driver binding back-end, such as Lab::VISA or Linux-GPIB, plus its dependencies. Please 
see the documentation of these packages for more details.
