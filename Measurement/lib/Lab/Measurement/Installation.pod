Lab::Measurement::Installation - Installation guide for Lab::Measurement

=head1 Introduction

Since Lab::Measurement does not contain any device driver code itself, its installation is 
pretty straightforward. However, before you can actually use it, you will have to install
a driver binding back-end, such as Lab::VISA or Linux-GPIB, plus its dependencies.

Install dependencies of our perl modules. Depending on how familiar you are
with the perl infrastructure, the easiest might be to use PPM, the Perl Package Manager
included with ActivePerl.

Lab::Tools needs

 XML::Generator (PPM would write it as XML-Generator)
 XML::DOM
 XML::Twig
 YAML

=head1 Installation on Windows XP with Strawberry Perl

Strawberry Perl is a Perl distribution for Windows that most closely
mimics a Perl installation under Linux. It comes with gcc compiler, dmake
and the other relevant tools included.

Lab::Measurement should in principle install out of the box with just the command

	cpan Lab::Measurement

executed on the commandline.

=head1 Installation on Linux

As a Linux user you will probably be able to figure out most things yourself. 
You will need the dependencies; best you'll use your distribution package management
to install these:

 XML::Generator (PPM would write it as XML-Generator)
 XML::DOM
 XML::Twig
 YAML
 ... and GnuPlot.
