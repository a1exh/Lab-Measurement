=head1 NAME

Lab::Measurement - Log, describe and plot data on the fly

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Lab::Measurement;
  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module distribution simplifies the task of running a measurement, writing 
the data to disk and keeping track of necessary meta information that usually 
later you don't find in your lab book anymore.

If your measurements don't come out nice, it's not because you were using the 
wrong software. 

The entire stack can be loaded by a simple 

  use Lab::Measurement;

command; further required modules will be imported on demand.
