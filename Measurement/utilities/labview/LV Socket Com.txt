If the Oxford Instruments IsoBus master is controlled via serial port from a machine
also running LabView (e.g. with the OI IGH control software), the serial port is locked
and cannot be accessed from Perl. 

This VI "reexports" the serial port via a network socket and makes it possible to
sneak Perl control scripts in there too.
