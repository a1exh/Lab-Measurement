README for Lab::Measurement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lab::Measurement allows to perform test and measurement tasks with Perl scripts. It
provides an interface to several instrumentation control backends, as e.g. LinuxGPIB or
National Instruments' NI-VISA library. Dedicated instrument driver classes relieve the
user from taking care for internal details.

See https://www.labmeasurement.de/ for further information, including installation
instructions.
