README for Lab::Measurement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lab::Measurement allows to perform test and measurement tasks with Perl scripts. It
provides an interface to several instrumentation control backends, as e.g. LinuxGPIB or
National Instruments' NI-VISA library. Dedicated instrument driver classes relieve the
user from taking care for internal details.

See https://www.labmeasurement.de/ for further information.


INSTALLATION AND USAGE

The Lab::Measurement package is distributed on the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN). A general introduction to the installation of CPAN modules is
provided in [0]. Essentially, Lab::Measurement can be installed by any CPAN
client, e.g. cpanm, by running

 $ cpanm Lab::Measurement

with the command-line prompt (e.g. bash on Linux or cmd.exe on MS
Windows). The CPAN client will download and install Lab::Measurement from CPAN
and will verify the installation by running the module's unit tests.

Depending on the used hardware, additional Perl modules, such as LinuxGPIB,
Lab::VISA, or Lab::VXI11 might need to be installed. Hardware back-end specific
documentation and installation instructions are contained in [1].

The Lab::Measurement modules can now be used by measurement scripts. A script
is executed by running

 $ perl script.pl

with the command-line prompt.
Examples of measurement scripts can be found in the Lab::Measurement tutorial
[2].
