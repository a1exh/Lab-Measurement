package Lab::Moose::Sweep::Continuous;

#ABSTRACT: Base class for continuous sweeps (temperature, magnetic field)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Lab::Moose;

 #
 # 1D sweep of magnetic field
 #
 
 my $ips = instrument(
     type => 'OI_Mercury::Magnet'
     connection_type => ...,
     connection_options => {...}
 );

 my $multimeter = instrument(...);
 
 my $sweep = sweep(
     type => 'Continuous::Magnet',
     instrument => $ips,
     from => -1, # Tesla
     to => 1,
     rate => 0.1, (Tesla/min, always positive)
     start_rate => 1, (optional) rate to approach start point
     interval => 0.5, # one measurement every 0.5 seconds
 );

 my $datafile = sweep_datafile(columns => ['B-field', 'current']);
 $datafile->add_plot(x => 'B-field', y => 'current');
 
 my $meas = sub {
     my $sweep = shift;
     my $field = $ips->get_field();
     my $current = $multimeter->get_value();
     $sweep->log('B-field' => $field, current => $current);
 };

 $sweep->start(
     datafiles => [$datafile],
     measurement => $meas,
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This C<sweep> constructor defines the following arguments

=over

=item * from/to

=item * rate

=item * interval

If C<interval> is C<0>, do as much measurements as possible.

Warn if measurement requires more time than C<interval>.
